# Etch a Sketch

Draw using your mouse and relive the classic handheld toy.

[Live demo](https://gregolive.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) ðŸ‘ˆ

## Functionality

- The Etch A Sketch console was made using CSS and is modeled after the original toy.
- Select between 3 input options...
- Greyscale adds layers of gray and on mulitple these stack and darken. 
- Psycadelic adds random colors from an array of 20+ of javascripts prenamed colors.
- Custom allows the user to select a color from a color picker and input a color of their choice.
- The grid density is also customizeable using a slider.
- The screen is cleared using a clear button on the Etch A Sketch console. Clicks are accompanied by a shake animation as a nod to how the handheld toy was cleared by physcially shaking it.

## Reflection

This project was a big step up from the Janken Javascript project, but the knowledge from the before made this a fun problem to tackle. The biggest problem was implementing the color picker, however, a helpful Stackoverflow thread made this manageable. Setting up the grid using Javascript was also difficult at first and it took me a while to realized that a second nested for loop was needed to make both rows and columns. 

Otherwise laying everything out in a visually pleasing way with CSS took some time, especially when it came to making the Etch A Sketch device. I was quite happy with the result of this in the end, though, and the extra time was worth it.
